# OmniOne OpenDID Demo App Pages

Welcome to the **OmniOneID DemoApp Repository**!<br>
This repository contains the source code and deployment files for **OmniOneID DemoApp Pages**.

## Purpose
This demo website is designed to:
- **Enhance accessibility** by allowing users to experience OpenDID's functionality without installing an app.
- **Maintain consistency** by applying the same design as the app, minimizing any sense of unfamiliarity.

## Differences from the App
The DemoApp provides a user experience similar to the actual OmniOneID app but with the following differences:
- The **UI and interaction flow** are identical, but no real data is used.
- **QR codes for VC issuance and VP submission** are simulated and do not perform actual credential transactions.
- **LockType settings and fingerprint authentication** are not supported.

## Key Screens
- App Start Screen
